    Work is better when done together — that’s the whole reason why we prioritize deep integrations withboth designers’ and developers’ tool stacks.
    
    We’ve rounded up a few stories about how teams use Zeplin with design tools like Adobe XD and Figma plussome fun ways we’ve made use of our new integration with Zapier.
    We kicked off a new webinar series last month: Zeplin + Figma: Better Together!
    Up first was Katherine Lee, principal UX visual designer and manager at Autodesk, who shared howleveraging Zeplin and Figma together became a critical part of her team’s workflow.
    In case you missed it, we recently released our integration with Zapier. But, before we could roll outthis new feature to our users, we wanted to test it for ourselves. That’s why we hosted an all-remoteZeplin + Zapier Hackathon! To get your workflow muscles warmed up, we wanted to share the winning “Zaps”from our internal hackathon. Enjoy!
    
    Once you’ve caught up on the first episode of our Zeplin + Figma: Better Together series, head over toour second conversation with the ArcTouch product team. We chatted with product designers BárbaraFontenelle and Ricardo Machado and product manager Danielle Diehl to learn more about their workflowDigital Experience specialist Lanna Solci joined Electrolux, a global Swedish maker of home appliances,to help refine their processes for building digital experiences integrated with physical appliances. Shespoke with our crew on how her team has adopted a workflow encompassing Zeplin, Overflow and Adobe XD.
    ​​See you next month!
